								<p style="text-align:center;"> Hello All !</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">
									Thank you for taking time to know me better, your time is truly appreciated. 
									
									I am a young fellow who has graduated from Conestoga College pursed Advance Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. Throughout the Course Outcome, I have studied numerous courses which includes all the aspects of systems, design, and engineering. 
									
									I have done various projects including Capstone, Software developments, Object Oriented, Data Structures, User Interface Design, Embedded Operating System etc. </p>
									
									<p style = "text-align: center;">
									To get more insights on how I applied the knowledge gained from the courses in real life, please navigate to the projects section and click on Images that will lead to GitHub. 
									
									I am fueled by my passion for engineering, designing, front-end and back-end developing where every day I encounter countless challenges and to get over all of those is what keeps me awake and inspired which eventually makes me blissful before calling off my day. </p>

									<p style = "text-align: center;">
									I ruminate myself a ‘forever student’, enthusiastic to both build on my academic foundations in engineering and stay in tune with the latest breakthrough in technologies. 
									
									As a young gentleman, my long-term goal is not just to work for a company but be with a company to ultimately be in a chief position so that I can lead it some day with my acquaintance and skills for the growth of the business..
									</p>
